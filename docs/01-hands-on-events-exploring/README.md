## Hands-on Events Exploring - a simple EventStorming Example

If you are new to Event Storming, don't know how to start the domain event exploring journey, recommend to think about a timeline:

> how many immutable fact events occurred, from you wake up at this morning, until now you read this post.

Anyone of you could easily to figure out a couple of stickers there to present what you did in the morning. All of the **past-tense** wording is explaining what happened, immutable fact, and meaningful for your **"working day morning"**.

**[Challenge for you]** Imagine a specific scenario, it's time to attend a meeting but you are probably be late to join, can you pick the most essential stickers to complete the journey on timeline?

> The most key events you picked up, that's the critical path to "Attend meeting". On the other hand, if there is a product under developing, and the Product Owner opens whole bunch of wish list there, what approach will you take to survive under the pressure?

**The most valuable approach is to leverage "User story mapping" and "Impact mapping". Pick up the most essential ones to developer as first sprint, then continously exploring the story and refine it.**
